# Taylor Swift's Lyrics Analysis Project

## Overview
This project explores the lyrical journey of Taylor Swift, with a special focus on her "Midnights" album released on October 21, 2022. The aim is to uncover any hints she might have dropped in her previous lyrics about this album. The analysis covers her references to ‘midnight’ and extends to her mentions of day, night, and time in general. Additionally, the project involves sentiment analysis to examine Swift's tonal and vibe evolution throughout her career, determining her preference for day or night in her lyrics. This is an excellent opportunity to apply NLP and text analysis skills on real-world data.
